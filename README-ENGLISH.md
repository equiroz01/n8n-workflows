# üß† n8n Workflow Collection

This repository is a **fork** of the original initiative by [@Zie619](https://github.com/Zie619/n8n-workflows), who gathered n8n workflows from various sources, such as:

- The official [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/) site and its community forum.  
- Examples shared publicly on GitHub, blogs, and other websites.

The purpose of this repository is to offer a consolidated resource to inspire you, facilitate your learning, and allow you to reuse workflows in your own n8n projects.


## üìÇ Implemented Improvements

- **English Descriptions**: Each `.json` file was analyzed and given a clear description in English based on the actions it performs.  
- **Duplicate Removal**: The unique hash of each file was verified and validated to detect and remove duplicate workflows, ensuring that each workflow is unique in content.  
- **File Renaming**: File names were updated to more accurately describe their main functionality, making them easier to search for and select.


## üõ† Usage Instructions

To import any workflow into your n8n instance, follow these steps:

1. Open your n8n instance.
